			<!-- Bio -->
			<h4>Hi! I'm Kye Lin (they/them), a piano teacher with a passion for helping my students gain musical mastery.</h4>

			<p>My approach consists of providing <strong>concrete, bite-sized lessons</strong> and <strong>actionable steps</strong> for my students to practice. I ask questions to meet my students where they're at and make sure I'm tailoring our lessons to their goals. I always leave space for their questions or concerns. Through clear explanations, enthusiasm for learning, and adaptable teaching strategies, I help my students achieve their goals.</p>

			<p>I found my passion for teaching during high school, when I <strong>tutored 300+ hours</strong> in math, English/Writing, Mandarin Chinese, piano, and music theory to children ages 5-12. In addition, I started a piano lesson business where I provided one-on-one lessons for local neighborhood kids. Since then, I've tutored <strong>70+ students</strong>.</p>

			<p>I used to tutor on <a href="https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/89561590">Wyzant</a>, but I am transitioning to independent tutoring for more flexibility to support my students.</p>

			<p>Aside from English, I also speak Mandarin Chinese.</p>

			<h1>Rates</h1>
			<p>***I am currently based in the Folsom, CA area. I offer in-person and online lessons. For in-person, I would go to your home for the lesson and charge $2 for every 5 miles of travel.***</p>
			<p>30 minutes: $30</p>
			<p>60 minutes: $50</p>
			<p>Payment: I take Venmo or Zelle. Payment is due 24 hours after the lesson for the week ends. Or, you can pay for 4 or 5 lessons upfront at the beginning of the month.</p>
			<p>If you have circumstances that make it difficult to afford regular lessons, let me know and I am more than happy to discuss a discounted rate! I am a firm believer that music lessons should be accessible to anyone who wants to learn.</p>
			<p>If you are unsatisfied after our first lesson, I provide a full refund, no problem.</p>
