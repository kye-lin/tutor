			<h1>FAQs</h1>

			<p><strong>Do you offer one-time lessons? Do you offer weekly lessons?</strong></p>

			<p>Yes and yes! I'm ready to help whether you need regular tutoring long-term or support on an as-needed basis. Ideally, though, it is best to contact me 24 hours before you need a lesson to make sure I can find a time for you.</p>

			<p><strong>Do you offer a trial lesson?</strong></p>

			<p>Yes! I offer a FREE 30-minute trial lesson for all new students. Contact me if you're interested and we'll set that up!</p>

			<p><strong>What kinds of students do you teach? What ages?</strong></p>

			<p>I have experience teaching all ages. There is no age limit to learning :)</p>

			<p><strong>What styles of music do you teach?</strong></p>

			<p>I mainly teach classical and jazz piano. However, I've dabbled with pop and R&B styles too. </p>

			<p><strong>Do you teach CM?</strong></p>

			<p>I am not part of the Music Teachers' Association of California (MTAC), so I am not connected to the CM program. However, I am familiar with the requirements and am happy to help support students studying to pass those tests. I also have experience tutoring students on the theory exams, and they ended up passing with honors awards. </p>

			<p><strong>What's your cancelation policy?</strong></p>

			<p>I require 24 hour notice for a full refund. Otherwise, I will have to charge you as I have reserved time for you that could've been used for helping another student in need.</p>

			<p><strong>Who are you? What are your credentials?</strong></p>

			<p>I am an undergraduate student studying at the University of California, Berkeley. I started learning piano at the age of 2, playing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star with my sister as a four-hand piano duet. After that, I studied classical piano, taking Certificate of Merit (CM) tests until high school. Then, I continued to compete in classical music competitions, play jazz piano in my high school's big band and small combos, and accompany my local youth orchestra. Music has always been a huge part of my life, and I'd love to share what I've learned with you.</p>

		
			<h1>Rates</h1>
			<p>***I am currently based in the Folsom, CA area. I offer in-person and online lessons. For in-person, I would go to your home for the lesson and charge $2 for every 5 miles of travel.***</p>
			<p>30 minutes: $40</p>
			<p>45 minutes: $50</p>
			<p>60 minutes: $60</p>
			<p>Payment: I take Venmo or Zelle. Payment is due 24 hours after the lesson for the week ends. Or, you can pay for 4 or 5 lessons upfront at the beginning of the month.</p>
			<p>If you have circumstances that make it difficult to afford regular lessons, let me know and I am more than happy to discuss a discounted rate! I am a firm believer that music lessons should be accessible to anyone who wants to learn.</p>
			<p>If you are unsatisfied after our first lesson, I provide a full refund, no problem.</p>
