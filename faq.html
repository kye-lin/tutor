			<h1>FAQs</h1>

			<p><strong>Do you offer one-time tutoring? Do you offer weekly tutoring?</strong></p>

			<p>Yes and yes! I'm ready to help whether you need regular tutoring long-term or support on an as-needed basis. Ideally, though, it is best to contact me 8-12 hours before you need a lesson to make sure I can find a time for you.</p>

			<p><strong>How does online tutoring work?</strong></p>

			<p>After we connect, I will send you a Zoom link for our meeting. If you choose to continue regular sessions with me, you will use that same Zoom link every time.</p>

			<p><strong>What kinds of students do you teach? What ages?</strong></p>

			<p>I have experience teaching ages 5-40. There is no age limit to learning :)</p>

			<p><strong>What math do you tutor?</strong></p>

			<p>Anything up to Calculus 2. I tutor elementary math, middle school math, prealgebra, geometry, Algebra 1, Algebra 2, precalculus, AP Precalculus, AP Statistics, and more. I do not tutor anything above Calculus 2 (e.g. multivariable calculus, linear algebra, etc.)</p>

			<p><strong>What's your cancelation policy?</strong></p>

			<p>I require 24 hour notice for a full refund. Otherwise, I will have to charge you as I have reserved time for you that could've been used for helping another student in need.</p>

			<p><strong>Who are you? What are your credentials?</strong></p>

			<p>I am an undergraduate student studying Chemical Biology at the University of California, Berkeley. Having toiled through AP exams and weeder organic chemistry intro courses, I know what it's like to struggle and lose hope. I'm also aware of how much pressure is put on students to succeed at their organic chemistry and math courses when there isn't always enough one-on-one support. That's why I made it my mission to help students like me get back on track and take control of their education.</p>
