			<h4>Hi! I'm Kye Lin (they/them), a piano teacher with a passion for helping my students gain musical mastery.</h4>

			<p>I am a classical and jazz pianist who has been playing for ~15 years and teaching for ~2 years. I have experience teaching piano to students of all ages, from 5 to older adult (no one is ever "too old" to learn an instrument!). During lessons, I get to know my student's goals, design a practice plan, and check in regularly to see what's working and what's not. Performance-wise, my experiences include performing Schumann's Piano Concerto in A Minor with an orchestra at Music Fest Perugia, accompanying my local youth symphony orchestra, and jamming out with various jazz combos throughout high school and university. I also played in my local youth chamber orchestra for 2 years. I passed the Certificate of Merit Piano Levels 1-10 with Branch Honors.</p>

			<p>My teaching approach consists of providing <strong>concrete, bite-sized lessons</strong> and <strong>actionable steps</strong> for my students to practice. I ask questions to meet my students where they're at and make sure I'm tailoring our lessons to their goals. I always leave space for their questions or concerns. Through clear explanations, enthusiasm for learning, and adaptable teaching strategies, I help my students achieve their goals.</p>

			<p>I found my passion for teaching during high school, when I <strong>tutored 300+ hours</strong> in math, English/Writing, Mandarin Chinese, piano, and music theory to children ages 5-12. In addition, I started a piano lesson business where I provided one-on-one lessons for local neighborhood kids. Since then, I've tutored <strong>70+ students</strong>.</p>

			<p>Some of my favorite pianists are: Bill Evans, Red Garland, Chick Corea, Martha Argerich, Yuja Wang, Yunchan Lim</p>

			<h3>6 Reasons to Take Lessons with Me</h3>

			<li class="number-list">
				<ol>1. I provide <strong>concrete advice</strong> on how to improve. This kind of feedback is what distinguishes self-taught learners from those who have worked with a teacher.</ol>

				<ol>2. <strong>I cover all the bases.</strong> Technique, fingering, ear training, sight reading, learning repertoire, music theory, you name it.</ol>

				<ol>3. <strong>I make lessons fun and interesting.</strong> With my current students, I am known for having a <strong>warm, fun, and patient</strong> teaching style. You never have to worry about me droning on and on about theory or scales. Instead, I'm always open to YOUR thoughts and tastes. I am always learning and improving as a pianist too, so I share my passion and curiosity with my students as we explore our craft together.</ol>

				<ol>4. I have taken <strong>pedagogy</strong> coursework at the University of California, Berkeley. I regularly apply what I've learned. This means asking students guiding questions and making sure they're engaged in every step of the way.</ol>

				<ol>5. <strong>I keep students accountable. </strong>If a student hasn't practiced for more than one or two weeks, I have a discussion with them. Most times, we can work out a way to incorporate practice into their routine. If I find that they still don't prioritize piano practice, I talk with them about discontinuing lessons. I want to make sure that my time is spent supporting students with a genuine interest in developing their musical skills.</ol>

				<ol>6. <strong>I provide post-lesson summaries and resources</strong> in an email after every lesson at student request. These are personalized for YOU, so you can keep a record of what you've learned and what to practice in the upcoming week.</ol>
