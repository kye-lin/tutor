			<!-- Bio -->
			<h4>Hi! I'm Kye (they/them). I'm a science and math tutor with a passion for helping my students reach their highest academic potential.</h4>

			<p>My approach consists of providing <strong>concrete, bite-sized lessons</strong> and <strong>actionable steps</strong> for my students to practice. I ask guiding questions to encourage students to come to an understanding on their own. I always leave space for their questions or concerns. Through clear explanations, enthusiasm for learning, and adaptable teaching strategies, I help my students achieve their goals.</p>

			<p>I found my passion for tutoring during high school, when I <strong>tutored 300+ hours</strong> in math, English/Writing, Mandarin Chinese, piano, and music theory to children ages 5-12. In addition, I started a piano lesson business where I provided one-on-one lessons for local neighborhood kids. Since then, I've tutored <strong>70+ students</strong>, mainly for Organic Chemistry and Math (up to Calculus).</p>

			<p>I used to tutor on <a href="https://www.wyzant.com/tutor/profile">Wyzant</a>, but I am transitioning to independent tutoring for more flexibility to support my students.</p>
