			<!-- Bio -->
			<h4>Hi! I'm Kye (they/them). I'm a science and math tutor with a passion for helping my students reach their highest academic potential.</h4>

			<p>My approach consists of providing concrete, bite-sized lessons and actionable steps for my students to practice. I ask guiding questions to encourage students to come to an understanding on their own. I always leave space for their questions or concerns. Through clear explanations, enthusiasm for learning, and adaptable teaching strategies, I help my students achieve their goals.</p>

			<p>I found my passion for tutoring during high school, when I tutored 300+ hours in math, English/Writing, Mandarin Chinese, piano, and music theory to children ages 5-12. In addition, I started a piano lesson business where I provided one-on-one lessons for local neighborhood kids. Since then, I've tutored 70+ students.</p>
