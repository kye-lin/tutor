			<!-- Bio -->
			<h4>Hi! I'm Kye Lin (they/them), a science and math tutor with a passion for helping my students reach their highest academic potential.</h4>

			<p>My approach consists of providing <strong>concrete, bite-sized lessons</strong> and <strong>actionable steps</strong> for my students to practice. I ask guiding questions to encourage students to come to an understanding on their own. I always leave space for their questions or concerns. Through clear explanations, enthusiasm for learning, and adaptable teaching strategies, I help my students achieve their goals.</p>

			<p>I found my passion for tutoring during high school, when I <strong>tutored 300+ hours</strong> in math, English/Writing, Mandarin Chinese, piano, and music theory to children ages 5-12. In addition, I started a piano lesson business where I provided one-on-one lessons for local neighborhood kids. Since then, I've tutored <strong>70+ students</strong>, mainly for Organic Chemistry and Math (up to Calculus).</p>

			<p>I used to tutor on <a href="https://www.wyzant.com/match/tutor/89561590">Wyzant</a>, but I am transitioning to independent tutoring for more flexibility to support my students.</p>

			<p>Aside from English, I also speak Mandarin Chinese. I also know some basic ASL and fingerspelling.</p>

			<h1>Rates</h1>
			<p>***I offer in-person tutoring (in the Folsom, CA area) and online tutoring.***</p>
			<p>60 minutes: $35</p>
			<p>90 minutes: $53</p>
			<p>120 minutes: $70</p>
			<p><strong>My rates on Wyzant are different because Wyzant takes a large cut of my pay and requires extra service fees you'd have to pay. If you'd like to bypass this, please contact me by email rather than Wyzant.</strong></p>
			<p>Payment: I take Venmo or Zelle.</p>
			<p>If you have circumstances that make it difficult to afford regular tutoring (e.g. paying for college by yourself), let me know and I am more than happy to discuss a discounted rate!</p>
			<p>If you are unsatisfied after the first lesson, I provide a full refund, no problem.</p>

			<h1>Ready for a lesson?</h1>
			<p>Contact me at <a href="mailto:kyesqlin@gmail.com">kyesqlin [at] gmail [dot] com</a> to schedule a tutoring session.</p>
			<p>Helpful info to include in the email: grade, subject, goals, whether you're looking for short-term or long-term help, 2-3 times you're available to meet, any questions/concerns you have</p>
