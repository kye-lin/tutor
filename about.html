			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>Hi, I'm Kye Lin (they/them), an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. I'm a pre-med student working towards a B.S. in Chemical Biology with a passion for teaching and learning.</p>

			<p>Having toiled through AP exams and weeder organic chemistry intro courses, I know what it's like to struggle and lose hope. I'm also aware of how much pressure is put on students to succeed at their organic chemistry and math courses when there isn't always enough one-on-one support. That's why I made it my mission to help students like me get back on track and take control of their education.</p>

			<p>In addition to finding fulfillment from helping students learn and grow, I tutor as a side hustle to support my studies. Going to college these days ain't cheap!</p>

			<p>My teaching philosophy is that learning should be engaging every step of the way. That's why my lessons involve me asking guiding questions to lead students down the right train of thought. This approach maximizes student independence and retention as they get tested on the same ability to think critically and problem solve. I also incorporate warmth, fun, and personal connection into every lesson to make sure I'm taking care of my students and tailoring my lessons to their needs.</p>
